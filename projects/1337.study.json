  "longDescription": "1337.study is a spaced-repetition-based LeetCode studying platform. Using the SuperMemo 2 algorithm, it optimizes the review process by scheduling problems at increasing intervals, optimizing material retention. The platform tailors practice schedules to individual performance, ensuring effectiveness for learners of all skill levels.\nThe frontend is a SPA made with React Router in declarative mode. LeetCode has no public API, so a Playwright-based scraping approach was used on the backend to gather problem set questions.",
